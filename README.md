## Introduction

### Goals

 Programming and computer science are becoming more popular than ever -- major initiatives like the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/us) are popularizing learning  programming across the world.

As a consequence, there are an increasingly huge number of resources and tutorials being produced for beginners who want to learn to code, ranging from books to online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses _(MOOCS)_ like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

While this is great, it can also be overwhelming for beginners -- there are almost too _many_ resources available, and it's difficult to figure out where to start.

This page is meant to help solve that problem -- to present a **curated** list of resources for people who are either new to programming, new to a particular topic, or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage. This page doesn't try and list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

### Where do I start?

If you know what you want to learn about, great! Jump to that section, start browsing the links, and find something which works for you.

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- [Golang](#golang) (Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language, with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language.)
- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)
- [Java](#java) (general-purpose; Android development)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)
- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)

Python and Java are both languages that are [commonly used](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2016/) to teach programming to beginners in schools and universities, and there are a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also widely used in the industry which makes them useful languages to have in your toolbelt.

Web development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.

[Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y6J2jXjU34) is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together "blocks" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children _(elementary schoolers, middle school)_ or for people who dislike typing.

### How this page is organized...

This page is subdivided into three parts -- first, a _"General resources"_ section that links to sites that tend to deliver high-quality content about a variety of topics, and a _"Specific resources"_ section that provides resources on specific programming languages or topics.

In general, most resources available will fall between two categories -- online courses, and books + tutorials. Online courses tend to teach using video lectures, try and be more interactive, and try and emulate the structure of a course similar to ones you might take in college. In contrast, books and tutorials teach via written text and allow you to set your own pace.

### Where should I start?

Whether you prefer learning by watching a video or reading text is really a matter of personal preference. _I_ personally prefer visual, but your learning style might be completely different. You may need to explore and browse several different resources before you discover how you best learn.

In addition, you'll find that most links, whether they're online courses, tutorials, or books, tend to focus on either one of three things:

  1. Some resources focus on _programming_, _semantics_, or _computer science theory_ -- in other words, how to use a programming language to write something that works.
  2. Other resources will focus more on _coding_ and _syntax_ -- the particular details and rules about how a programming language works.
  3. Other resources focus on teaching _idioms_ -- teaching best practices specific to that language, the underlying philosophy of that language, or teaching you about the different libraries available to you: the broader ecosystem.

If you're new to programming, the first model will be the best. Programming is all about applied problem solving: being able to take a problem, and break it up into smaller and smaller pieces until they're small enough to translate into computer code. Simply memorizing a collection of rules will not be very useful to you. You also need to learn how to _apply_ those rules.

However, if you already know how to program, then you most likely already know how to do this. In that case, you're going to want to use the second kind since it'll be easier to learn about the differences between the language you're learning and ones you already know.

Once you've moved past the beginning phase, then it would be a good idea to try and move on to the third kind of resource, which will help teach you how to actually use and apply that language on a practical and professional level.

When I say that a resource is _"heavy in theory"_ or _"is rigorous"_, I mean that it leans towards the first category. When I say that a resource _"focuses on syntax"_, I mean that it leans towards the second. And when I say a resource _"focuses on idioms"_ or _"on practical applications"_, I mean that it leans towards the third.

### WARNING!

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).

You can also find a meta _"list of programming resources"_ aggregator here: http://resrc.io/


### Online courses

Online courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.

- **[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)** - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.
- **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)** - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- **[Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/)** - offers several free programming resources and mentored workshops on data science, UX design and more that can teach you Python, R, data science, and SQL with the help of an expert who works professionally.
- **[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)** - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- **[edX](https://www.edx.org/)** - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- **[OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses)** - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- **[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)** - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)** - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- **[Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx)** - static course materials taught at Stanford.
- **[Learn Code](https://www.youtube.com/learncodeacademy/)** - offers free online courses hosted on YouTube focusing primarily on greater JavaScript ecosystem. Covers everything from basic JavaScript, front end Web Apps, NodeJS and some of the more popular frameworks. Also covers other topics such as basic Git usage, and SSH.
- **[Do What You Love (DWYL)](https://github.com/dwyl)** - over 150 tutorials in the form of Github repositories, covering languages such as JavaScript, HTML5, Elixir and Elm; platforms like AWS, Digital Ocean, and Azure; other tools like CodeShip and Github; and also covering basics on architecture, security, and test driven design  
- **[Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/)** - Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns collects and distills successful techniques in planning a reengineering project, reverse-engineering, problem detection, migration strategies and software redesign.
- **[Computer Musings (lectures by Donald Knuth)](http://scpd.stanford.edu/free-stuff/engineering-archives/donald-e-knuth-lectures)** - The Stanford Center for Professional Development has digitized more than one hundred tapes of Knuth's musings, lectures, and selected classes and posted them online.
- **[NASA Software Measurement Handbook](https://www.scribd.com/doc/7181362/NASA-Software-Measurement-Guidebook)**
- **[Introduction to Functional Programming (class lectures and slides)](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/Lectures/funprog-jrh-1996/)** - Introduction and Overview Functional and imperative programming: contrast, pros and cons. General structure of the course: how lambda calculus turns out to be a general programming language. Lambda notation: how it clarifies variable binding and provides a general analysis of mathematical notation. Currying. Russell's paradox.
- **[Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge](https://www.computer.org/portal/web/swebok)** - The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK Guide) describes generally accepted knowledge about software engineering. Its 15 knowledge areas (KAs) summarize basic concepts and include a reference list pointing to more detailed information.
- **[Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/)** - Programming language ‘‘paradigms’’ are a moribund and tedious legacy of a bygone age. Modern language designers pay them no respect, so why do our courses slavishly adhere to them? This paper argues that we should abandon this method of teaching languages, offers an alternative, reconciles an important split in programming language education, and describes a textbook that explores these matters.
- **[Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com)** - Producing Open Source Software is a book about the human side of open source development. It describes how successful projects operate, the expectations of users and developers, and the culture of free software.
- **[97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/97_Things_Every_Programmer_Should_Know)** - 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know project, pearls of wisdom for programmers collected from leading practitioners. You can read through the Contributions Appearing in the Book plus the Other Edited Contributions, browse Contributions in Progress, view the list of Contributors, and also learn How to Become a Contributor. If you would simply like to comment on a contribution, please also read How to Become a Contributor as some of it applies to you.
- **[Type Theory and Functional Programming](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/)** - Constructive Type theory has been a topic of research interest to computer scientists, mathematicians, logicians and philosophers for a number of years. For computer scientists it provides a framework which brings together logic and programming languages in a most elegant and fertile way: program development and verification can proceed within a single system.
- **[Operating Systems and Middleware (PDF and LaTeX)](https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/os-book/)** - Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction by Max Hailperin

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- **[Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)** - focuses on web and iOS development.
- **[Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- **[PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)** - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.
-  **[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.

### Haskell
Haskell is a [polymorphically](https://wiki.haskell.org/Polymorphism) [statically typed](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typing), [lazy, purely functional](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lazy_evaluation) language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for [Haskell Brooks Curry](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Brooks_Curry), whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the [lambda calculus](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambda_calculus), hence the lambda they use as a logo.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Note: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies that runs on every web browser and makes up every webpage.

HTML is a language used to describe the _structure_ and _content_ of a webpage. CSS is used to describe the _style_ and _appearance_. JavaScript is used to add _behavior_ and _interactivity_.

The recommended learning order is typically to start with HTML and CSS, then move on to learning JavaScript once you feel you've acquired a basic understanding of the previous two.

Also note that HTML and CSS are examples of "markup languages", not "programming languages" and so will feel fairly different from JavaScript. If your goal is to learn just programming, you might want to jump straight ahead to JavaScript (or pick a different programming language!).

### Perl
Businesses talk about Perl 5 when talking Perl, but on a far-far land, beyond deep-thinking island, the design-by-committee tribe is still cooking a hefty slab of Perl 6 (and it's almost ready, with an engine written in Haskell and powered by the tears of the gods)

**Ok, that said, what is Perl 5 used for, today?**

- **legacy web systems / intrawebs** - some just won't die

- **data mining / statistical analysis** - the perl regex engine, even if slightly outdated, (PCRE, a spinned off library, tops it up in any possibile way and it's the default PHP engine) is still good for simple analysis

- **UNIX system administration **- Perl shall always be installed on UNIX.
You can count on it being readily available even on Mac OS X.

- **Network Prototyping **- many core network experts learned Perl when it was all the rage; and they still do their proofs-of-concept with it.

- **Security** - many security experts, too, need fast prototyping. (and fast automated fixes) Perl can, and does, cover for that.

The extensive CPAN collection is very handy, when dealing with prototypes.
(Batteries may not be included, but they're still right there, on the shelf)

**Remember drawbacks, though:**

- Object support in Perl sucks hard, you bless references and do unholy stuff in the name of objects, then wonder why you took all the trouble in the first place.
- Reading other people's Perl is more than a craft, it's science, and a painful one, too.
- Perl is nifty, it makes you think nifty, it makes you feel nifty, you become a programming rockstar. Now, think about getting up, and going to work in a office full of rockstars: it's a "boat that rocks" hard. Expect wild fluctuations.

- **Online courses:** N/A

### PHP

Note: while PHP can be very convenient, quick, and easy to use, it's also a language viewed negatively by many programmers. (See [PHP: a fractal of bad design][php-fractal]). If you do decide to learn PHP and adopt it as your language of choice, just be aware of the fact that people will probably make fun of you at one point or another.

Also, it's important to first learn [HTML and CSS](#html-css-and-javascript) before attempting to learn PHP. PHP is a language which attempts to "extend" and work with HTML, so may not fully make sense if you try and learn it before picking up basic web development.

### Python

Note: there are currently two versions of Python that are commonly taught and used -- Python 2, and Python 3. Python 3 is the most recent version, but for a variety of reasons Python 2 still is fairly popular among many developers.

If you're not sure which version to pick, my recommendation would be to pick the resource which looks like the best fit for you, and just use whatever version they're recommending. Luckily, the differences between the two are very minor (at least from the perspective of the beginner), so there's really no difference if you learn using Python 2 vs Python 3.

- **Online courses:**
    - edx's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][python-mit-intro]
      The companion book can be [found here][python-mit-intro-book]. The course is designed for beginners, part of a 2-part series, is self-paced, and has an emphasis on computation and data science.
        -   MIT Open Courseware also offers a gentler "lead-in" course designed for those with no programming background that you can take before taking the above: [Building Programming Experience: A Lead-In to 6.001][python-mit-lead-in].

### Golang
The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

In addition to the resources available [at golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/#learning) there are a range of community-driven initiatives:

- **Orgs:**
  - [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/): Building Bridges That Educate &
Empower Underrepresented Communities

### Scratch

Scratch is a language wherein you create programs by dragging together and connecting "blocks". Unlike other programming languages, Scratch is very visual, making it a very good first programming language, especially for children and younger teens.

Because not many people may be familiar with Scratch, this section will contain resources that are helpful both for _learning_ Scratch, and _teaching_ Scratch.

## Data

### Neo4j and Graph Databases

[Neo4j][Neo4j] is an open source NOSQL graph database, implemented in Java. It saves structured data in graphs rather than in tables. Graph databases simplify and speed up access to data that is complex and contains many connections. They use graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to store and access connected information, and can traverse parts of the data without touching the whole graph.

Neo4j is widely used for:

- Highly connected data
- Recommendation
- Path Finding
- Data First Schema
- Schema Evolution
- A* (Least Cost Path)

- **Online courses:**
    - [Neo4j Training][Neo4j-Training] - free course, completely online
    - [GraphGist][GraphGist] - geek out on real graphs on finance, sports, politics, or even The Hobbit

### MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an open-source [NoSQL database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) engine built in C++.

It's a document-store database which means it stores data as a "document" inside a collection, with multiple collections inside a database. Multiple databases can exist for each server. The document data is stored as [BSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON) which is [JSON](http://www.json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) in a binary format for performance. The data is [schema-less](https://www.google.com/search?q=schema-less&oq=schema-less&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.446j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) which means each document can have as many keys and values as you want with no restriction on the type of data.

It's easy to think of documents in collections like rows in a relational database table, except that these documents can have any arbitrary amount of properties (like columns for rows) and they can be different for each document and include lots of nesting like arrays of more properties. This is very powerful way to store complex data and matches up well to the object-oriented nature of most programming languages.

MongoDB runs on both Windows and Linux servers and has lots of documentation and years of production usage now so it's considered a stable and useful database, although there are continuing issues with durability and an overly-complicated replication setup to keep in mind.

## Introduction

### Goals

 Programming and computer science are becoming more popular than ever -- major initiatives like the [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/us) are popularizing learning  programming across the world.

As a consequence, there are an increasingly huge number of resources and tutorials being produced for beginners who want to learn to code, ranging from books to online tutorials to interactive websites to massive open online courses _(MOOCS)_ like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

While this is great, it can also be overwhelming for beginners -- there are almost too _many_ resources available, and it's difficult to figure out where to start.

This page is meant to help solve that problem -- to present a **curated** list of resources for people who are either new to programming, new to a particular topic, or want to advance their skills past the beginner stage. This page doesn't try and list every single resource available, but instead links to resources that are guaranteed to be high-quality.

### Where do I start?

If you know what you want to learn about, great! Jump to that section, start browsing the links, and find something which works for you.

If you're not sure where to start and which language to learn, some good beginner languages are:

- [Golang](#golang) (Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language, with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language.)
- [Python](#python) (general-purpose; scientific and mathematical computing)
- [Java](#java) (general-purpose; Android development)
- [HTML/CSS/JavaScript](#html-css-and-javascript) (websites and webapps)
- [Scratch](#scratch) (for younger children)

Python and Java are both languages that are [commonly used](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2016/) to teach programming to beginners in schools and universities, and there are a wide variety of resources available to help you learn. They're also widely used in the industry which makes them useful languages to have in your toolbelt.

Web development has been very popular lately, so there are many resources for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also making it suitable for learning. It requires little to no installation and configuration on your computer. All you need is a text editor to write code -- the code will run on your web browser.

[Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y6J2jXjU34) is a little different from other languages. It was designed from the ground up to be easy to use and learn -- instead of typing text, you drag and connect together "blocks" to form programs, making it a very visual language. As a result, Scratch is a good language especially for younger children _(elementary schoolers, middle school)_ or for people who dislike typing.

### How this page is organized...

This page is subdivided into three parts -- first, a _"General resources"_ section that links to sites that tend to deliver high-quality content about a variety of topics, and a _"Specific resources"_ section that provides resources on specific programming languages or topics.

In general, most resources available will fall between two categories -- online courses, and books + tutorials. Online courses tend to teach using video lectures, try and be more interactive, and try and emulate the structure of a course similar to ones you might take in college. In contrast, books and tutorials teach via written text and allow you to set your own pace.

### Where should I start?

Whether you prefer learning by watching a video or reading text is really a matter of personal preference. _I_ personally prefer visual, but your learning style might be completely different. You may need to explore and browse several different resources before you discover how you best learn.

In addition, you'll find that most links, whether they're online courses, tutorials, or books, tend to focus on either one of three things:

  1. Some resources focus on _programming_, _semantics_, or _computer science theory_ -- in other words, how to use a programming language to write something that works.
  2. Other resources will focus more on _coding_ and _syntax_ -- the particular details and rules about how a programming language works.
  3. Other resources focus on teaching _idioms_ -- teaching best practices specific to that language, the underlying philosophy of that language, or teaching you about the different libraries available to you: the broader ecosystem.

If you're new to programming, the first model will be the best. Programming is all about applied problem solving: being able to take a problem, and break it up into smaller and smaller pieces until they're small enough to translate into computer code. Simply memorizing a collection of rules will not be very useful to you. You also need to learn how to _apply_ those rules.

However, if you already know how to program, then you most likely already know how to do this. In that case, you're going to want to use the second kind since it'll be easier to learn about the differences between the language you're learning and ones you already know.

Once you've moved past the beginning phase, then it would be a good idea to try and move on to the third kind of resource, which will help teach you how to actually use and apply that language on a practical and professional level.

When I say that a resource is _"heavy in theory"_ or _"is rigorous"_, I mean that it leans towards the first category. When I say that a resource _"focuses on syntax"_, I mean that it leans towards the second. And when I say a resource _"focuses on idioms"_ or _"on practical applications"_, I mean that it leans towards the third.

### WARNING!

This page is still a **work-in-progress**! Some sections may currently be incomplete, and some links may not yet be fully vetted.

## General resources

### Links to other big lists

You can find a huge and utterly massive compendium of [list of free programming books and resources on github](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). (It used to be hosted on StackOverflow, but was moved over to Github on October 2013).

You can also find a meta _"list of programming resources"_ aggregator here: http://resrc.io/


### Online courses

Online courses are an increasingly popular way for universities and professionals to teach programming and computer science in a structured format. As a result, new online courses will pop up all the time, so it's worth checking these resources periodically to see what's new.

- **[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)** - offers free online courses in several different languages. However, Codecademy does have a tendency to teach only basic syntax, so you may need work through more tutorials after finishing Codecademy. Focuses mainly on web development, Ruby, and Python.
- **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)** - offers free online courses in many different fields from several different well-known universities. New courses are added every quarter, and content from old courses is typically archived. Because many courses appear to be new/may be a one-time thing, this page will not link to courses on Coursera unless it appears to be stable.
- **[Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/)** - offers free computer science courses taught by industry experts. Udacity offers two kinds of courses -- regular courses and nanodegrees. Regular courses are free. Regular courses with one-on-one tutoring/code review requires a monthly fee. Nanodegrees are typically for people with some prior coding experience, and cost more money.
- **[edX](https://www.edx.org/)** - a joint effort between MIT, Harvard, and Berkeley to provide free online versions of some of their courses.
- **[OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses)** - similar to all of the above. Video lectures are typically available on iTunes or Youtube. Typically does **not** require you to complete assignments, unlike many other online courses.
- **[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)** - static course materials taught at MIT. Unless otherwise noted, most content from this website tends to be very rigorous and fast-paced.
- **[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)** - contains a few courses on programming and computer science; does contain many more courses on all kinds of topics (especially math).
- **[Stanford Engineering Everywhere](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx)** - static course materials taught at Stanford.
- **[Learn Code](https://www.youtube.com/learncodeacademy/)** - offers free online courses hosted on YouTube focusing primarily on greater JavaScript ecosystem. Covers everything from basic JavaScript, front end Web Apps, NodeJS and some of the more popular frameworks. Also covers other topics such as basic Git usage, and SSH.
- **[Do What You Love (DWYL)](https://github.com/dwyl)** - over 150 tutorials in the form of Github repositories, covering languages such as JavaScript, HTML5, Elixir and Elm; platforms like AWS, Digital Ocean, and Azure; other tools like CodeShip and Github; and also covering basics on architecture, security, and test driven design  

The following websites also contain a wide variety of tutorials for many different topics, but require payment and registration before you can access their courses.

- **[Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)** - focuses on web and iOS development.
- **[Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.
- **[PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)** - similar to Lynda, but with a focus on developer and IT courses.
-  **[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)** - also includes courses on design, animation, video, business, and more.

In general, edX, OpenCulture, MIT OpenCourseware, and Stanford Engineering Everywhere tend to contain more rigorous, thorough, and demanding courses, whereas Codecademy and Khan Academy tend to focus on giving a more gentle introduction to programming. Coursera and Udacity tend to vary between these two extremes.


## Programming Languages

### Haskell
Haskell is a [polymorphically](https://wiki.haskell.org/Polymorphism) [statically typed](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typing), [lazy, purely functional](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lazy_evaluation) language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for [Haskell Brooks Curry](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_Brooks_Curry), whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the [lambda calculus](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambda_calculus), hence the lambda they use as a logo.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Note: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies that runs on every web browser and makes up every webpage.

HTML is a language used to describe the _structure_ and _content_ of a webpage. CSS is used to describe the _style_ and _appearance_. JavaScript is used to add _behavior_ and _interactivity_.

The recommended learning order is typically to start with HTML and CSS, then move on to learning JavaScript once you feel you've acquired a basic understanding of the previous two.

Also note that HTML and CSS are examples of "markup languages", not "programming languages" and so will feel fairly different from JavaScript. If your goal is to learn just programming, you might want to jump straight ahead to JavaScript (or pick a different programming language!). However, since the main way to actually use JavaScript is through the web browser, you _do_ need to learn HTML and CSS at one point or another.

### Perl
Businesses talk about Perl 5 when talking Perl, but on a far-far land, beyond deep-thinking island, the design-by-committee tribe is still cooking a hefty slab of Perl 6 (and it's almost ready, with an engine written in Haskell and powered by the tears of the gods)

**Ok, that said, what is Perl 5 used for, today?**

- **legacy web systems / intrawebs** - some just won't die

- **data mining / statistical analysis** - the perl regex engine, even if slightly outdated, (PCRE, a spinned off library, tops it up in any possibile way and it's the default PHP engine) is still good for simple analysis

- **UNIX system administration **- Perl shall always be installed on UNIX.
You can count on it being readily available even on Mac OS X.

- **Network Prototyping **- many core network experts learned Perl when it was all the rage; and they still do their proofs-of-concept with it.

- **Security** - many security experts, too, need fast prototyping. (and fast automated fixes) Perl can, and does, cover for that.

The extensive CPAN collection is very handy, when dealing with prototypes.
(Batteries may not be included, but they're still right there, on the shelf)

**Remember drawbacks, though:**

- Object support in Perl sucks hard, you bless references and do unholy stuff in the name of objects, then wonder why you took all the trouble in the first place.
- Reading other people's Perl is more than a craft, it's science, and a painful one, too.
- Perl is nifty, it makes you think nifty, it makes you feel nifty, you become a programming rockstar. Now, think about getting up, and going to work in a office full of rockstars: it's a "boat that rocks" hard. Expect wild fluctuations.

- **Online courses:** N/A

### PHP

Note: while PHP can be very convenient, quick, and easy to use, it's also a language viewed negatively by many programmers. (See [PHP: a fractal of bad design][php-fractal]). If you do decide to learn PHP and adopt it as your language of choice, just be aware of the fact that people will probably make fun of you at one point or another.

Also, it's important to first learn [HTML and CSS](#html-css-and-javascript) before attempting to learn PHP. PHP is a language which attempts to "extend" and work with HTML, so may not fully make sense if you try and learn it before picking up basic web development.

- **Online courses:**
    - Codecademy's [PHP track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php)
    - Team Treehouse's [PHP course](http://teamtreehouse.com/features/php) - allows a free 14-day trial, but later requires payment.

### Python

Note: there are currently two versions of Python that are commonly taught and used -- Python 2, and Python 3. Python 3 is the most recent version, but for a variety of reasons Python 2 still is fairly popular among many developers.

If you're not sure which version to pick, my recommendation would be to pick the resource which looks like the best fit for you, and just use whatever version they're recommending. Luckily, the differences between the two are very minor (at least from the perspective of the beginner), so there's really no difference if you learn using Python 2 vs Python 3.

- **Online courses:**
    - edx's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python][python-mit-intro]
      The companion book can be [found here][python-mit-intro-book]. The course is designed for beginners, part of a 2-part series, is self-paced, and has an emphasis on computation and data science.
        -   MIT Open Courseware also offers a gentler "lead-in" course designed for those with no programming background that you can take before taking the above: [Building Programming Experience: A Lead-In to 6.001][python-mit-lead-in].
    - MIT Open Courseware's [A Gentle Introduction to Programming Using Python][python-mit-gentle]
      A gentler version of the above.

### Golang
The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

In addition to the resources available [at golang.org](http://golang.org/doc/#learning) there are a range of community-driven initiatives:

- **Books (online):**
  - [The Little Go Book](http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/) The Little Go Book is a free introduction to Google's Go programming language. It's aimed at developers who might not be quite comfortable with the idea of pointers and static typing. It's longer than the other Little books, but hopefully still captures that little feeling.
- **Books (paper):**
  - [Go in Action](http://www.amazon.com/Go-Action-William-Kennedy/dp/1617291781/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-2&keywords=golang): Go in Action introduces the Go language, guiding you from inquisitive developer to Go guru. The book begins by introducing the unique features and concepts of Go. Then, you'll get hands-on experience writing real-world applications including websites and network servers, as well as techniques to manipulate and convert data at speeds that will make your friends jealous.
  - [The Way to Go: A Thorough Introduction to the Go Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Way-Go-Thorough-Introduction-Programming-ebook/dp/B0083RVAJW/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-9&keywords=golang): Pros - Book is very relevant and up-to-date, well-structured (maybe too well-structured at times), covers virtually everything in Go language, has a myriad of useful code examples. Cons - Author is not a native speaker and it shows. At times it is a bit hard to understand his writing - proofreading was definitely needed.
  - [Introducing Go: Build Reliable, Scalable Programs](http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Go-Reliable-Scalable-Programs/dp/1491941952/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-6&keywords=golang): Perfect for beginners familiar with programming basics, this hands-on guide provides an easy introduction to Go, the general-purpose programming language from Google. Author Caleb Doxsey covers the language’s core features with step-by-step instructions and exercises in each chapter to help you practice what you learn.
  - [The Go Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460415974&sr=8-1&keywords=golang): The Go Programming Language is the authoritative resource for any programmer who wants to learn Go. It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you’ll find it accessible whether you’re most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.

## Data

### Neo4j and Graph Databases

[Neo4j][Neo4j] is an open source NOSQL graph database, implemented in Java. It saves structured data in graphs rather than in tables. Graph databases simplify and speed up access to data that is complex and contains many connections. They use graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to store and access connected information, and can traverse parts of the data without touching the whole graph.

Neo4j is widely used for:

- Highly connected data
- Recommendation
- Path Finding
- Data First Schema
- Schema Evolution
- A* (Least Cost Path)

- **Online courses:**
    - [Neo4j Training][Neo4j-Training] - free course, completely online
    - [GraphGist][GraphGist] - geek out on real graphs on finance, sports, politics, or even The Hobbit

### MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an open-source [NoSQL database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) engine built in C++.

It's a document-store database which means it stores data as a "document" inside a collection, with multiple collections inside a database. Multiple databases can exist for each server. The document data is stored as [BSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON) which is [JSON](http://www.json.org/) (JavaScript Object Notation) in a binary format for performance. The data is [schema-less](https://www.google.com/search?q=schema-less&oq=schema-less&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.446j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) which means each document can have as many keys and values as you want with no restriction on the type of data.

It's easy to think of documents in collections like rows in a relational database table, except that these documents can have any arbitrary amount of properties (like columns for rows) and they can be different for each document and include lots of nesting like arrays of more properties. This is very powerful way to store complex data and matches up well to the object-oriented nature of most programming languages.

MongoDB runs on both Windows and Linux servers and has lots of documentation and years of production usage now so it's considered a stable and useful database, although there are continuing issues with durability and an overly-complicated replication setup to keep in mind.
